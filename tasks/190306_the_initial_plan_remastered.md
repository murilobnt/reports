### Define the output of the application

Build an example of a desired output of the application. I've already done this before so, eh, I'm just going to put it as 100% again.

**Completion:** ![task0_completion](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

---

### Define classes

Create the classes needed for basic operation.

**Completion:** ![task1_completion](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

---

### Get a Makefile

I don't want to recompile everything on hand everytime.

**Completion:** ![task2_completion](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

Notes: Took it from another project.
