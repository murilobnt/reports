# The Initial Plan

*This was generated by the application. I believe this can give everyone valuable insight about what exactly I've created.*

## Summary

- [x] [Define the output of the application.](#define-the-output-of-the-application)
- [x] [Define classes.](#define-classes)
- [x] [Get a Makefile.](#get-a-makefile)

### Define the output of the application

![task0_completion](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

Build an example of a desired output of the application. I've already done this before so, eh, I'm just going to put it as 100% again.

---

### Define classes

![task1_completion](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

Create the classes needed for basic operation.

---

### Get a Makefile

![task2_completion](http://progressed.io/bar/100)

I don't want to recompile everything on hand everytime.

**Notes:** *Took it from another project.*
