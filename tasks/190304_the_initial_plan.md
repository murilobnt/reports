*This was not generated by the application.
Yet, I believe this can give me valueable insight
about what exactly I am going to create.*

## Summary

- [x] [Define the output of the application.](#define-the-output-of-the-application)
- [ ] [Define classes.](#define-clases)
- [ ] [Get a Makefile.](#get-a-makefile)

### Define the output of the application

Build an example of a desired output of the application. This will contribute to think about how the application will work.

**Completion:** 100%.

---

### Define classes

Create the classes needed for basic operation.

**Completion:** 0%.

**Notes:** Probably won't be completed soon haha.

---

### Get a Makefile

I don't want to recompile everything on hand everytime.

**Completion:** 50%.

## New ideas

1. Reuse past reports (unsolved tasks).
2. Multiple languages suport.
