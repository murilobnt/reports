# Reports

A tool for writing reports for code repositories.

## Description

**Reports**, or **Results Presentation**, is a tool that aims to
abstract the process of writing periodic reports, so there would be no need to
worry about styles or any document syntax, but the information it will contain.

The report, as of now, is understood as a markdown document with a title, date,
description and a number of tasks.

## Requires

-   [GCC.](http://gcc.gnu.org)

## Compile and Execute

Once you download this project or clone this repository, you might want to
compile the code. To do so, go to the root directory of the project, through
terminal, and enter the following command:

```
make
```

If no errors occured, still at the root of the project:

```
./bin/results_presentation
```

## Usage

While in execution, you might see a "." in the terminal. This means you may
enter a command to interact with the application. If you wish to know what
commands are available, enter the "help" command.

## Considerations

This project is at its initial state. If you want to try to break it, you'll
possibly succeed. If so, the outcome is unpredictable, for me.

This is an example of an output generated by the tool: [tasks/190306_the_initial_plan_remastered.md](https://github.com/murilobnt/reports/blob/master/tasks/190306_the_initial_plan_remastered.md)
